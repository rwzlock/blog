# Blog

##Background
* The goal of this blog is to document my progress in Data Science and serve as a notepad for me to retain the concepts that I learn.
* I will be using the Machine Learning Mastery Blog as my primary reference but I will also write about ongoing projects and new technologies I am working with.
